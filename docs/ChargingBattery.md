#### Charging the battery
We use a 2 Cell 7.4 V Turnigy LiPo Battery to power the RC car.

Be careful with the battery. For your safety:
* Never leave the battery charging while unattended.
* Never let the voltage drop below 6.0V
* Never charge the battery to over 8.4V (the charger should automatically stop charging at 8.4 V).
* Never charge the battery at higher than 5.0Amps
* When the car is not in use, donâ€™t leave the battery connected to the
ESC or the buck converter.
* If the battery starts smoking or gets on fire, treat it as a chemical fire

The video below provides a basic overview of how to charge the battery.

 When charging, note the following
* Use the three-pin balance port
* Use aligator clips to clip onto the battery terminals
* Set up the charging mode settings as 2S, 7.4V, 5.0A. (note, 2S means 2 cell)


#### Monitoring the voltage
We recommend using a battery cell checker to monitor the voltage of the battery.
Letting it drain too low could permanently damage the battery. These checkers have a
simple display to show the current voltage, and an alarm to sound when the voltage is too low.
There are many vendors that sell these checkers, here is [one](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18588__HobbyKing_8482_Cell_Checker_with_Low_Voltage_Alarm_2S_8S_.html) that we use.

Below is a video about how to use one
